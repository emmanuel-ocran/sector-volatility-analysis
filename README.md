# Sector Volatility Analysis  
*Author: Emmanuel Ocran*  

This project analyzes seven years of historical stock data (June 2018 â€“ May 2025) to evaluate sector-level volatility, returns, and risk-adjusted performance. Using key financial metrics like daily returns, rolling volatility, and Sharpe Ratios, the analysis highlights how major sectors perform under different market conditions.

## Objectives  
- Clean and unify daily stock price data across sectors  
- Engineer features: daily returns, rolling volatility, Sharpe Ratio  
- Compare sector risk and performance over time  
- Identify the most resilient sectors during downturns  
- Provide insights to support informed investment decisions  

## Sectors Analyzed

- Jupyter Notebook  
- yfinance (data source)   

## Key Insights  
- Technology sector delivered the highest risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio)  
- Energy sector exhibited the highest volatility with the lowest efficiency  
- Sector returns showed moderate positive correlations, limiting diversification  
- Technology and Consumer Discretionary recovered fastest post-COVID-19 downturn
